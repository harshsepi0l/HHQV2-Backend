Backend for Hornet HQ Version.2 (Prototype)
[please ask one of the Backend Members before changing anything]

-- Only for Backend Changes --
To get started: -- Use the CLI and make sure to have Node installed on your system -- type ' npx prisma install ' -- if it asks you to update to the latest verison, try it (does not work most of the time).

DB CLI (Use only if we need to pull/push new tables): -- ' npx/npm prisma db pull ' to pull all the tables from the database (introspection). -- ' npx/npm prisma db push ' to push all the tables from the prisma client (outrospection). -- ' npx/npm prisma help ' to get help for the CLI

If your using studio then run these CLI: -- ' npx/npm prisma generate ' to generate the models for the client

-- 'npx/npm prisma studio ' to visually see the models in a localhost

-- Please look at the notion on how to make the .env file

Happy Coding!
