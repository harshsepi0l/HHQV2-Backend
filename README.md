# HHQV2-Backend

Backend for HHQV2 (Prototype)

To get started:
-- Use the CLI and make sure to have Node installed on your system
-- type ' npx prisma install '
-- if it asks you to update to the latest verison, try it (does not work most of the time).

DB CLI (Use only if we need to pull/push new tables):
-- ' npx/npm prisma db pull ' to pull all the tables from the database (introspection).
-- ' npx/npm prisma db push ' to push all the tables from the prisma client (outrospection).
-- ' npx/npm prisma help ' to get help for the CLI

-- ' npx/npm prisma generate ' to generate the models for the client

-- 'npx/npm prisma studio ' to visually see the models in a localhost

Happy Coding!
